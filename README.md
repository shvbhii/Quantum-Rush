# üöÄ Quantum Rush - Day [X] of #30DaysOfVibeCoding

Welcome to **Quantum Rush**, a fast-paced, futuristic car reflex game built with React and modern web technologies. Players must overcome a series of dynamic hurdles by typing key sequences against the clock. This project was built as part of my **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge, where I build and ship a new web project every single day.

## üåü About The Project

Quantum Rush is a single-page application that tests your typing speed and reflexes. The game is set on a straight, animated road where your car automatically moves forward. When a hurdle appears, the car stops, and you are presented with a challenge: type a sequence of random keys within a 3-second time limit.

Success means your car performs a slick jump animation over the obstacle and speeds on to the next level. Failure results in a "Game Over" screen. The game features 5 sequential levels with an increasing number of keys and complexity, creating a challenging difficulty curve that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The entire UI is built with a sleek, modern, dark-first design and is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üí° Project Philosophy: Vibe Coding ‚ö°Ô∏è

-   **Component Logic:** Writing boilerplate and core logic for React components and state management with Zustand.
-   **Problem-Solving:** Quickly identifying and fixing bugs, like the initial infinite re-render issue.


This method allows for a focus on the bigger picture‚Äîthe "vibe," functionality, and user experience‚Äîwhile minimizing time spent on syntax and boilerplate, making rapid development for a 30-day challenge possible.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

While the core game is complete, here are some ideas for future enhancements:

-   [ ] Add a leaderboard to track high scores.
-   [ ] Introduce different car models with unique stats.
-   [ ] Implement sound effects for key presses, jumps, and crashes.
-   [ ] Explore a 3D version using React Three Fiber.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/shvbhii/Quantum-Rush.git/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
